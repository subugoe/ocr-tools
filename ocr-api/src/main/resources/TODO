This is the TODO File for the OCR API
- Maybe we need a common Interface for configuring an OCREngine (default languages and formats)
- add a method to set different scripts for a process (Gothic)
- add a method to observe an OCREngine - this can be later used with JMX
- split abstract classes and interfaces to seperate dependencies
- add an OCRengineFactory including discovery of engines at runtime
- check if some setters can be removed
