This is the TODO File for the OCR API
- Maybe we need a common Interface for configuring an OCREngine (default languages and formats)
- There should be a common method to get metadata for a finished process or result
- Add a Boolean to OCROutput to indicate that it contains results of a finisher Process
- Add a Factory for the different Engines
- Finish JavaDoc
- add a method to observe an OCREngine - this can be later used with JMX
